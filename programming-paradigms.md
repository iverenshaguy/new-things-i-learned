**Definitions**
- Declarative and Imperative Programming (thanks to @Dikaeinstein)
    - Declarative Programming
      `A programming paradigm … that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow` i.e. says what is wanted without saying how to get it e.g CSS, HTML, some parts of SQL (SELECT especially since the dev does not know how the system produces the data).
      
      For part of the program to be more declarative, other parts must provide the abstraction to hide the implementation details (which are the imperative codes) - @engineforce on StackOverflow.

    - Imperative Programming
      `A programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state` i.e. provides the step by step approach to get what is wanted.
      
    e.g (as gotten from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1784664/what-is-the-difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-programming))

  There are 4 main programming paradigms (declarative, imperative, functional and object oriented).
  
  I mainly used these posts and StackOverflow questions to get a good understanding.
